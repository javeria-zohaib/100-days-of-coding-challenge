Question 46: Enhanced Laptop Object: Construct an object for a laptop including properties make, model, year, and a method describe() that logs a sentence about the laptop.

Explain & TIP: Objects can also contain functions (methods) that can perform actions using the object's properties. This introduces method definition within objects.*/
